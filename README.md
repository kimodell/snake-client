# Snake Client Project

Snake game is a very popular video game where the player maneuvers a dot, or snake, that grows by ‘eating’ pieces of food, or in this case, rectangles. As it moves and eats, the snake grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle itself. The goal is help the snake grow as big as possible, but don't touch the sides, or the snake's tail! If your snake runs into the walls, or itself, your snake will die, and you will have to play again with a new, small snake.

The Snake Client Project is simply a multiplayer take on the snake game, with some sassy messages to shout at your opponent!

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.
